Times and times again, you've heard it: a good portfolio is what will get you that great job/internship/fame/etc. in this new technical field you're diving into. You worked hard on your project, and made sure it was great in substance and form. You polished your code, commented so anyone could understand, and it's time to showcase your work. Here is how to upload your code to GitHub if you used Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio, respectivey (arguably the most popular Data Science programming languages and IDEs out there). We will go over the pros and cons as a user, for your readers, and if you intent to collaborate (which is what GitHub is for). Buckle up! 


1. Python | Jupyter Notebooks



2. R | RStudio
