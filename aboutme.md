My name is Berenice Dethier. I am a Bioengineer turned Data Scientist.
This is what you need to know:

- I love building IKEA furnitures. In fact, call me if you are putting together anything IKEA.
- I *can be* a food snob, but really it's for your own good.
- I am NOT a drink snob. I like everything, unless it's too sweet.
- I'm extremely loyal to my family.
- In previous seasons of life, I used to dance salsa and attend performed art (of any type, but lots of comedy clubs). Presently, I enjoy adult stuff, like running, hiking, reading and cooking.


### my story

I love Science, and I love a good challenge. So I studied Bioengineering, hoping to change the world... 

When that didn't happen, and because I enjoyed research, I started a PhD at the University of Liege (Belgium). I was studying (smelly) molecules extracted from garlic which (may) have awesome health benefits. During my program, I visited Dr Eric Block at UAlbany, and liked working there so much that I negociated a joint program agreement between the two schools. With Dr Block, we expanded the research to the chemistry of olfaction. I graduated from both universities in 2016 with a double degree in Chemistry and Bioengineering. 

After that, I worked for a few years as a Research Scientist at a company providing services to the Pharma industry. How do drug manufacturers - and really the FDA - know the "beyond use date" to print on the package? Because they ran a study. We created and validated analytical methods to measure the actual dosage of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient for each of our clients' formulation, then we designed and performed a stability study.
I learned a lot, managing projects, training junior coworkers and interacting with clients (one of them was the [US Pharmacopeia](https://www.usp.org/), shout-out to their awesome team!). 

I missed solving problems, however. I had been attracted to Data Science for a while: the balance between creativity and technical knowledge seemed like a good fit to keep my curious brain busy. It also felt like the future of everything: AI would solve problems in healthcare, medicine, technology, environmental science, ... I wanted to be a part of it! I also enjoy the opportunities Data Science offer in social impact work.

I studied Programming and Data Science (and brushed up Stats and Programming knowledge from my undergrad days), initially by myself (books and MOOCs). Then I joined Springboard and graduated from their Data Science career track in 2020. 

### my interests

I'm repeating myself at this point, but applying AI and machine learning to health, physiology, (bio)chemistry, and science in general are huge motivations.

My previous projects include:
- Work on predicting the date of birth of a child based on demographic and biological data (we worked with the CDC Natality files)
- The prediction of the number of open ion channels based on electrophysiological signals

More soon!
